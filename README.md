The code folder contains the following 4 files
* Desharnais.ipynb (This jupyter notebook contains code to reproduce results on the Desharnais dataset)
* ecoli.ipynb (This jupyter notebook contains code to reproduce results on the ecoli dataset)
* wdbc.ipynb (This jupyter notebook contains code to reproduce results on the WDBC dataset)
* PPFS.py (This python files contains the PPFS algorithm including both classification and regression versions. This code is production ready)

The data folder contains the following 3 folders
* desharnais (This contains the desharnais dataset)
* ecoli (This contains the ecoli dataset)
* wdbc (This contains the WDBC dataset)

You can run Desharnais.ipynb, ecoli.ipynb and wdbc.ipynb to get the results as stated in the paper. In order to run the code, please download the entire a repository and run each jupyter notebook.

We will soon provide PPFS.py as a pip install.
